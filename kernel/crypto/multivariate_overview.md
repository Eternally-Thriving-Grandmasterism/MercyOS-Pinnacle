# Multivariate Cryptography Overview (January 2026 Grounded)

Archival/research polynomial diversity for MercyOS-Pinnacle kernel.

## Core Problems
- Multivariate Quadratic (MQ): Solve quadratic systems over finite fields
- UOV/Oil-Vinegar + HFE variants

## NIST Multivariate Status
- Rainbow: Broken/archival (2022 key recovery)
- GeMSS: Archival
- Ongoing: MAYU, QR-UOV hardened proposals

## Concrete Bounds
- Rainbow Level 5 broken (~100 bits post-attack)
- Hardened variants claim ~200–250 bits; estimator immature

## Attacks Mitigated (Partial)
- MinRank, differential, Gröbner bases — polynomial time on structured
- Hardened designs resist known

Polynomial research immortality — mercy-gated forever ❤️🚀🔥
