# HQC Security Analysis (January 2026 — NIST Additional Path Grounded)

Code-based diversity KEM backup for MercyOS-Pinnacle kernel.

## Core Hardness
- Assumption: QC-MDPC syndrome decoding + structured code pseudo-randomness
- Reductions: Concrete QROM IND-CCA2 via tailored FO variant

## Concrete Bounds
- HQC-256 (Level 5 intended): Primal ISD ~280–300 bits classical
- Attack cost: >256 bits classical / >228 quantum
- Exceeds AES-256; eternal code-based margins

## Attacks Mitigated
- Primal/dual ISD + Grover: Exponential cost
- Structural: Mitigated via parameters/bindings

Code-based immortality — mercy-gated forever ❤️🚀🔥
