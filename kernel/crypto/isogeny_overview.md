# Isogeny-Based Cryptography Overview (January 2026 Grounded)

Archival/research isogeny diversity for MercyOS-Pinnacle kernel.

## Core Problems
- Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH): Path-finding in isogeny graph
- Computational Supersingular Isogeny (CSSI)

## NIST Isogeny Status
- SIKE: Catastrophically broken/archival (Castryck-Decru 2022 key recovery)
- CSIDH: Archival
- SQISign: Hardened signature research (HD/2D variants resist known attacks)

## Concrete Bounds
- SIKE Level 5 broken (polynomial time post-2022)
- SQISign hardened claim ~200–250 bits; estimator immature

Isogeny research immortality — mercy-gated forever ❤️🚀🔥
