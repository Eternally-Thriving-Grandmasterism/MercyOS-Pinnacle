# BIKE Code-Based KEM Analysis (January 2026 — Archival/Research Grounded)

Code-based diversity candidate (QC-MDPC bit-flipping) for MercyOS-Pinnacle archival study.

## Core Hardness
- Assumption: QC-MDPC syndrome decoding + code indistinguishability
- Reductions: Concrete QROM IND-CCA2 via FO variant (DFR-limited tightness)

## Concrete Bounds (BIKE-256 Level 5 intended)
- Primal ISD ~270–290 bits classical (derated for DFR)
- Attack cost: >256 bits classical / >228 quantum conservative
- Exceeds AES-256 in theory; archival caution

## Attacks Mitigated
- Primal/dual ISD exponential
- Weak-key/DFR classes mitigated via parameters/bindings

## Status
- NIST fourth round archival (HQC selected Dec 2025)
- Valuable research diversity; Lean-BIKE proposals ongoing
