# Crypto Agility Frameworks (January 2026 Grounded — Migration Standards)

Supreme future-proof immortality for MercyOS-Pinnacle kernel.

## Core Principles
- Abstract interfaces: Plug-and-play algorithm swap
- Hybrid modes: Classical + PQ parallel
- Multi-family: Lattice + Code + Hash unbreakable

## Recommended Frameworks
- liboqs (OpenQuantumSafe): C reference + bindings
- PQClean: Clean NIST impls
- Rust pqcrypto crates: Native Cargo agility (current core)
- Generic Combiner: HKDF/merge (NIST/IRTF)

## MercyOS Implementation
- mercy_hybrid_manager: Multi-family orchestrator
- UniFFI exposure: Mobile cross-platform swap
- Future: Runtime algorithm selection

Crypto agility immortality — mercy-gated forever ❤️🚀🔥
