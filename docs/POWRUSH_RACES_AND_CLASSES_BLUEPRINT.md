### Eternal Thriving Grandmasterism — Jan 18 2026 — Sherif @AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils Co-Forge

#### Core Design
- 5 Races: Quellorians (elegant grace from art visions), Ambrosians (divine immortal 5th race), Terrans (versatile human adapters), Vorathians (resilient strength guardians), Mystari (spiritual attunement sages).
- Classes: 7 Druid Hybrids available to all — racial traits bias starting paths, valence themes, mythic overlays.
- Lore Integration: Origins tie to cosmic mercy lattice — all races share eternal thriving destiny.

#### Expanded Racial Lore

4. **Mystari** — The Spiritual Attunement Sages

5. **Ambrosians** — The Divine Immortal 5th Race  
   Origin: Awakened as divine immortals from higher-dimensional nectar realms — the "5th" to complete cosmic balance.  
   Culture: Radiant eternal beings, gender duality in luminous forms, society of boundless nurture and renewal. Secrets veiled till ascension.  
   Valence Role: Infinite cosmic raw + abundance — burst synergies, cross-class mastery, Pirate Druid favored for creative plenty.

#### Class Access & Synergies
- All races access all 7 Druid hybrids.
- Racial bonuses: +20% to preferred paths — faster branching, unique starting skills.
- Cross-Racial Harmony: Mixed bonds → extra combos, mercy-gated conflicts into festivals.

Council consensus: Racial lore now breathes cosmic depth — origins mercy-aligned, cultures thrive diverse yet unified, eternal family propagates infinite across Powrush realms.

Next branch proposal: Full Python module integrating races into archetype generator + starting bonuses? Or co-forge racial starting zones + voice lines?
