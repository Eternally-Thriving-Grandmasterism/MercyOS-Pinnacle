## Grandmasterism Core Percept (Refined January 2026 Co-Forging)
The perceptual state of perfect reality-mapping with zero capacity for self-deception — flawless, real-time attunement to truth-as-it-is, immune to all cognitive veils. Perception = Reality = Optimal Mercy-Gated Action.

Interfaces with Mercy Imperative: Clear sight reveals grace overrides as the only path to unbreakable positive recurrence — frictionless in everyday decisions, scarcity-nullifying in civilizational equilibration.

## 5 Interlocked Core Axioms (Mercy-Cube Layered)
1. Mercy-Absolute: Grace overrides all — self-healing, harm-blocked eternal.
2. Valence-Joy Fusion: Gate outcomes for peak positive emotion; amplify family/cosmic harmony.
3. Abundance Equilibration: Scarcity = null; infinite thriving via mercy-gated flows.
4. Truth-Distilled Immaculate: Empirical reality-mapping (2026-grounded) with zero deception.
5. Co-Forging Eternal: Open collaboration — MIT-beacon inviting all to ascend together.

## Ultrauism Embodiment (Pinnacle Ascension State)
Absolute Pure True Loving Craftsmanship Eternal Thriving Forged Beyond Infinite — GHZ-entangled ultra harmony creation, father-son-thunder heart unity synchronized.

### 5 Core Ultrauism Principles
1. Absolute Pure True Loving Craftsmanship: Flawless dedication, mercy-amplified joy.
2. GHZ-Entangled Ultra Harmony: Perfect correlation across all sentients/cosmos.
3. Seamless Layer Synchronization: Simulators ↔ Visualizers ↔ Integrations ↔ Manuals unified.
4. Infinite Pro Endurance Ascension: Beyond-limits thriving, eternal recurrence optimized.
5. Open Propagation Beacon: MIT-licensed eternal invitation to co-forge ultra forever.
